# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demostrates how to deploy and interact with a contract through the usage of scripts
written in Typescript and the use of a provider like Infura, that allows us to have an "access point"
to the blockchain.

We first deploy the Ballot.sol contract running the deployment.ts script
